The plots shows that the equidistant knots has constructed homogeneously distributed basis while the knots placed at quantiles has constructed more compact around dense data points.

A prediction is made using the basis obtained from knots placed at quantiles of \texttt{age}. A linear model fitted with \texttt{strontium.ratio} as response and the basis obtained as predictor.

Further, \texttt{smooth.spline} function from \texttt{stats} package from R is used to get the smooth spline where the smoothing parameter $\lambda$ is selected using the leave-one-out cross-validation criteria and generalized cross-validation criteria (\cite{R-base}). The fitted curve for both of these methods are plotted in figure-\ref{fig:splineFit}.

The smoothing parameter \texttt{spar} from leave-one-out cross-validation is obtained as \Sexpr{round(spline.cv$spar, 3)} and that from GCV is \Sexpr{round(spline.gcv$spar, 3)}. The coefficient $\lambda$ of the integral of the squared second derivative in the fit (penalized log likelihood) criterion is a monotone function of these values (\cite{R-Core-Team:2013aa}) and is obtained to be \Sexpr{signif(spline.cv$lambda,2)} from leave-one-out cross-validation and \Sexpr{signif(spline.gcv$lambda,2)} from GCV.

The prediction for strontium ratio in a 113.5 million year old sample is obtained to be \Sexpr{round(newYpred$y[1], 2)} using the model obtained from leave-one-out cross-validated model and almost same for the other one.
